IMPLEMENTING ADVANCED ANALYTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING MODELS FOR PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS IN THE DATA WAREHOUSE

This project focuses on building a robust data warehousing solution using IBM Cloud Db2 Warehouse. The primary objective is to create a centralized platform for data management, integration, and analysis, enabling data architects to derive actionable insights for informed decision-making processes within an organization. By consolidating data from various sources and implementing effective ETL processes, the project aims to streamline data exploration and facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the organization's operations.
